    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conformal Prediction (CP)** is a framework that wraps around any predictive model and converts its point predictions into **prediction sets** (or **intervals** for regression) that contain the true label or value with a user-chosen probability (e.g. 90% or 95%).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key appeal of conformal prediction is that it provides **finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees** under very weak assumptions—primarily that the data are **exchangeable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conformal prediction is **not a predictive model itself**, but a **calibration layer** applied on top of an existing model such as linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Idea and Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of conformal prediction is to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“How uncertain should I be about this prediction, given how wrong my model has been in the past?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of outputting a single prediction, conformal prediction outputs a **set of plausible labels** such that, in repeated sampling, the true label lies inside the set with probability at least \\(1 - \\varepsilon\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantee:\n",
    "- Holds in **finite samples**\n",
    "- Does **not** depend on the correctness of the model\n",
    "- Does **not** assume any parametric form of the noise\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Assumption: Exchangeability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conformal prediction relies on **exchangeability** of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The joint distribution of the data does not change under permutations of the sample order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exchangeability is slightly weaker than i.i.d., but it still excludes:\n",
    "- Strong time dependence\n",
    "- Severe non-stationarity\n",
    "- Uncorrected distribution shift\n",
    "\n",
    "Violations of exchangeability are the most common reason conformal methods fail in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Full (Transductive) Conformal Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new input \\(x_{n+1}\\), conformal prediction:\n",
    "1. Tries each possible label \\(y\\)\n",
    "2. Measures how “strange” the pair \\((x_{n+1}, y)\\) looks compared to past data\n",
    "3. Keeps only labels that are **not unusually strange**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Choose a nonconformity measure\n",
    "\n",
    "A **nonconformity score** maps a labeled example \\((x_i, y_i)\\) to a real number measuring how unusual it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",

    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Augment data with a candidate label\n",
    "\n",
    "For a new input \\(x_{n+1}\\), consider a candidate label \\(y\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporarily add \\((x_{n+1}, y)\\) to the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Refit (if using full conformal) and compute scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Train or refit the underlying model on all \\(n+1\\) points and compute nonconformity scores:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\dots, \\alpha_{n+1}\n",

    "\n",
    "Let \\(\\alpha_{n+1}\\) be the score of the candidate example.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compute the conformal p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "p(y) = \\frac{|\\{ i : \\alpha_i \\ge \\alpha_{n+1} \\}|}{n+1}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Under exchangeability, these p-values are uniformly (or conservatively) distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Form the prediction set\n",
    "\n",
    "For a target error rate \\(\\varepsilon\\):\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}(x_{n+1}) = \\{ y : p(y) > \\varepsilon \\}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This set contains the true label with probability at least \\(1 - \\varepsilon\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Full conformal prediction requires retraining or reevaluating the model **for each candidate label**, which is computationally expensive for modern models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Split Conformal Prediction (Practical Variant)\n",
    "\n",
    "Split conformal prediction avoids repeated retraining and is the most widely used version in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Split data** into:\n",
    "   - Training set\n",
    "   - Calibration set\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train the base model** on the training set only.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute nonconformity scores** on the calibration set:\n",
    "   - Regression: residuals\n",
    "   - Classification: misclassification or probability-based scores\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute a quantile** of calibration scores:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   q = \\text{Quantile}_{(1-\\varepsilon)\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n_{\\text{cal}} + 1}\\right)}\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Predict for new data**:\n",
    "   - Regression interval:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     [\\hat{y}(x) - q,\\ \\hat{y}(x) + q]\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - Classification set:\n",
    "     include all labels whose scores are below the threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Split Conformal Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without retraining, the calibration residuals remain exchangeable with future residuals, preserving finite-sample coverage guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Guarantees Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The main guarantee is **marginal coverage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Over repeated draws of the entire dataset (training, calibration, and test point), the prediction set contains the true label with probability at least \\(1 - \\varepsilon\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important clarifications:\n",
    "- Coverage is **not conditional on a specific \\(x\\)**\n",
    "- Some subpopulations may be over- or under-covered\n",
    "- Guarantees are frequentist, not Bayesian\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Online and Streaming Conformal Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conformal prediction can be adapted to streaming settings:\n",
